# RMate for VS Code

A package that implements the TextMate's 'rmate' feature for Visual Studio Code.

This is a fork of [rafaelmaiolla/remote-vscode](https://github.com/rafaelmaiolla/remote-vscode) fixing some features that probably almost nobody noticed they exist, for e.g.:

- Open multiple files at once with `rmate file1 file2`
- Closing files with `-w` flag which is useful for using rmate in `EDITOR`-env variable.  
  Example: `EDITOR='rmate -w' sudoedit somefile`

  When the VS Code tab is closed, the rmate session behind it is closed as well.

  Alternatively there's a command for closing single Sessions or all Sessions at once:

* Login to your remote server with a remote port tunnel

  ```
  
  Or configure SSH to always create a tunnel by editing `~/.ssh/config`:
  ```
  Host *
    RemoteForward 52698 127.0.0.1:52698
  ```

* Go to the remote system and run
  ```bash
  rmate file1 file2
  ```

* If you want to use rmate in `EDITOR` variable, you can use it like this:
  ```
  EDITOR='rmate -w' sudoedit important_file
  ```
